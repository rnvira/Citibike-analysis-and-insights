# Citibike-analysis-and-insights
Project for Syracuse University's School of Information Studies course IST 659

## Background
Citi Bike is a bike sharing program run in New York City(NYC), Jersey city, & Hoboken.
The purpose of the program is to create an ecosystem where commuters and riders are
able to save time and money to get around the town with convenience and ease. The
programâ€™s mission is also to provide health benefits through cycling and zero down on
the emissions and the carbon footprint on the environment.
Users can unlock a bike from the docking stations that are spread across the entire
cities listed in the previous paragraph. Post unlocking, a user can take rides for any
amount of duration and finally return the bike once the ride is completed to any docking
station present in the vicinity. With increasing traffic congestion in hustling cities, Citi
bikes are proving to be a preference for all sorts of daily commuters and are also turning
out to be an exciting way for travelers to explore the city.

## Problem Statement & Solution
For a program that clocks in 100,000 trips in a single day, there are infinite data points
that get captured but may not prove to be insightful for the organization. Additionally, for
large scale use cases like Citi Bike, the data that is being captured needs to be mapped
and processed accurately in order identify opportunities and ensure the progress of the
program. Hence, it becomes extremely important to maintain and manage the data
being collected and processed well. This will not only help in taking informed decisions
but also minimize uncertainty and uncover potential gaps for improvement.
For the above reasons, we decided to take up the Citi Bike Database in order to analyze
and identify insights that could potentially highlight scope for new initiatives and
improvements to the existing setup. Our goal for this project was to provide actionable
insights to the Business teams for certain problem statements by cleaning, processing,
modifying and managing the data through the raw data dump that we sourced from the
Citi Bike official website. Through this project, we would highlight the data points that
would indicate growth opportunities, streamline operations and eventually have a
positive impact on the revenue for the Citi Bike business.
Post implementation of our system, we will be able to provide data-backed answers to
key Business use cases like:
* Average trip duration - This will help the Business teams to streamline their
operations for the allocation of bikes on docking stations that will eventually
optimize the number of trips per bike
* Popular bike make & model based on trip duration - Identifying top bike make &
model based on trip duration to assist the Business teams in deciding to
capitalize more on a particular make and model of the bike. This will also help
them identify what bikes are more efficient and trustworthy for longer/shorter trip
durations thus ensuring better customer experience
* Average age of the customer riding bike - This will help the management in
deciding whether the bikes need certain age-specific modifications to enhance
rider comfort and experience. This will also help in planning duration per trip and
thereby help in improving the turnaround time per ride.
